Certainly! Here's an example of a GitHub README file for your IP Sniffer Rust program:

---

# IP Sniffer

IP Sniffer is a simple command-line tool written in Rust for scanning open ports on a given IP address using multiple threads. It supports specifying the number of threads for parallel scanning.

## Usage

```sh
ip_sniffer.exe [FLAG] [THREADS] IP_ADDRESS
```

- `FLAG`: Optional. Use `-j` to specify the number of threads, or `-h` for help.
- `THREADS`: Optional. Number of threads to use for parallel scanning.
- `IP_ADDRESS`: Required. The target IP address to scan for open ports.

## Examples

- Scan a single IP address with the default number of threads (4):
  ```sh
  ip_sniffer.exe 192.168.1.1
  ```

- Specify the number of threads (e.g., 8) for parallel scanning:
  ```sh
  ip_sniffer.exe -j 8 192.168.1.1
  ```

- Display help message:
  ```sh
  ip_sniffer.exe -h
  ```

## Building and Running

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. To build and run the program, use the following commands:

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/ip_sniffer.exe [ARGS]
```

## Notes

- This tool is designed for educational purposes and should be used responsibly.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform port scanning on the target IP address.

Feel free to modify and extend the code for your specific needs. Happy scanning!
